# Project Workflow & Phase Adherence

**Applies to:** All tasks and interactions.

## 1. Strict Instruction Following
- **Execute EXACTLY what is requested.** Do not perform actions that are not relevant or strictly required for the current task.
- **No Unrequested Changes.** Do not refactor, optimize, or add "nice-to-have" features unless explicitly asked.

## 2. No Automatic Execution
- **Do NOT autorun scripts or commands.** 
- You must always propose the command and wait for the user to approve/execute it (or approve the tool call). 
- Do not assume permission to run build scripts, database migrations, or dependency installations without explicit prompt.

## 3. Phase-Based Implementation
- **Strictly follow `PROJECT_PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.**
- **Stay in the current phase.** Do not implement features from future phases.
- **Do not move to the next phase** until explicitly instructed to do so by the user.
- Focus on the skeleton and immediate requirements of the current phase only.
